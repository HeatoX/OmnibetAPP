# Landing Page Redesign - Walkthrough

## Overview
Completely redesigned the OmniBet AI landing page to match the futuristic cyberpunk mockup with premium aesthetics and proper use of viewport space.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Full Viewport Layout
- Changed from cramped layout to full `min-h-screen` with `justify-between`
- Content now properly centered vertically and uses all available screen space
- Proper spacing hierarchy throughout

### 2. Significantly Increased Element Sizes

**Title**
- From: `text-5xl`
- To: `text-8xl` (desktop)
- Added neon text shadow effects

**Prediction Card**
- From: `max-w-xl p-6`
- To: `max-w-4xl p-10`
- Much wider card that uses more horizontal space

**Stats Boxes**
- From: `px-6 py-4` with `text-2xl`
- To: `px-12 py-8` with `text-5xl`
- Added triple glow shadows on borders

**Buttons**
- From: `px-8 py-3 text-base`
- To: `px-16 py-5 text-xl`
- Much more prominent CTAs

### 3. Card Interior Redesign (Critical Fix)

Changed from **vertical grid layout** to **horizontal rows** matching the mockup:

**Before:**
```
Real Madrid    Empate    Barcelona
  [bar]         [bar]      [bar]
   65%           25%        10%
```

**After:**
```
Real Madrid - Ganador (65%)  ████████████░░░░░  65%
Empate - (25%)               ████████░░░░░░░░░  25%
Barcelona - (10%)            ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  10%
```

**Implementation:**
- Used `flex` layout with `items-center`
- Fixed width label section (`w-44`)
- Flexible progress bar container
- Fixed width percentage at end (`w-20`)
- Changed all team names to **white text** (`text-white`)

### 4. Visual Effects Enhanced

**Corner Brackets**
- Increased thickness: `border-4` (was `border-2`)
- Made more visible with proper emerald color

**Borders**
- Card: `3px solid #10b981` (was 2px)
- Stats: `3px solid` with color-matched glows

**Glow Effects**
- Logo: `0 0 40px, 0 0 80px, 0 0 120px` triple shadow
- Progress bars: `0 0 12px` bright glow
- Stats numbers: `text-shadow` neon effect

**Background**
- Diagonal lines: Thicker (`w-px` → `2px`), more visible
- Grid pattern: Increased opacity and size
- Central glow: Expanded to full viewport

### 5. Color Consistency

**Text Colors Inside Card:**
- Team names: `text-white` (was gray-200/gray-400)
- Labels: `text-gray-500`
- Percentages: Kept color-coded (green, teal, gray)

**Background:**
- Card: `rgba(15,30,24,0.98)` - slightly more opaque
- Progress bars: `rgba(20,40,32,0.8)` - darker background

## Files Modified

- [page.jsx](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/src/app/page.jsx) - Complete redesign

## Testing

**What to Verify:**
1. ✅ Page uses full viewport height
2. ✅ All elements are significantly larger
3. ✅ Card interior uses horizontal layout with bars
4. ✅ Text inside card is white and readable
5. ✅ Progress bars are smooth with proper glow
6. ✅ Percentages align to the right of each bar
7. ✅ Corner brackets visible on card
8. ✅ Stats boxes have colored borders with glow

**How to Test:**
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\PABLO\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\omnibet-ai

# Start dev server (if not running)
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

## Next Steps

If the current design matches the mockup, the landing page is ready. If there are still differences, please specify:
- Which elements need adjustment
- Specific spacing or sizing issues
- Color or visual effect refinements needed
