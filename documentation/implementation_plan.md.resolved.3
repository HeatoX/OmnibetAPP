# OmniBet AI Landing Page Redesign

## Problem
Current landing page focuses too much on futuristic aesthetics and doesn't clearly communicate:
- What the product does

## Solution
Create a conversion-focused landing page inspired by successful SaaS platforms that:
1. **Immediately clarifies the value** - "AI-Powered Sports Betting Intelligence"
2. **Shows proof of value** - Display real predictions with win rates
