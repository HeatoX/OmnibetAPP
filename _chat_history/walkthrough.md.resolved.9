# Dashboard Layout Refinement Walkthrough

We have refined the layout of the OmniBet AI dashboard to improve readability and information hierarchy.

## 🏁 Final Refinements

### 1. Sport Categories Repositioning
The **Sport Filter** (Categorías) has been moved from the bottom of the page to the **Premium Predictions Center**, specifically right below the **"Análisis de Hoy"** (Stats Preview) section. This groups all "Today's Insights" in one logical vertical zone.

### 2. Side-by-Side Sports
We ensured that **NFL** and **Tenis** icons appear together in the filter bar, optimizing the use of horizontal space.

### 3. Full-Width Parlay Builder
The **Parlay Builder** now takes up the full width of the main container, giving match names and predictions plenty of space and preventing any text from being cut off.

### 4. Direct Prediction Text
Changed the text from "Probable: [Team]" to a more direct and concise **"GANA [Team]"**.

## 🚀 Impact
- **Increased Readability:** Text is no longer cramped or cut off on the right side.
- **Improved Flow:** Users see the big-picture stats and then immediately filter by their preferred sport.
- **Premium Feel:** The dashboard feels more professional and organized.
