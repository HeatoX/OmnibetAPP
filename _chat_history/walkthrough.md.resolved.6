# OmniBet AI - Project Update

## Summary
We have significantly expanded the application's capabilities with a focus on administrative control and showcasing the "Deep Analysis" value proposition to new users.

## Key Changes

### 1. Admin Dashboard with "God Mode"
- **New Admin Panel**: Accessible at `/admin` (for admin users).
- **Features**:
  - Dashboard with revenue and user stats.
  - User management (Block, Delete, Upgrade).
  - **God Mode**: A toggle in settings to instantly grant yourself "Diamond" tier access for free testing.

### 2. Deep Match Analysis (The Product)
- Enhanced the match analysis engine to generate **Narrative Insights**:
  - **Historical Curses**: Detects if a team hasn't won against another in years.
  - **Fortresses**: Highlights strong home records.
  - **Player Form**: Identifies players on scoring streaks.
- Visual tabs for H2H, Form, Rosters, and Injuries.

### 3. Landing Page Demo
- Added a **"Ver Análisis Demo"** button on the landing page hero section.
- Opens a fully interactive demonstration of the Detailed Analysis view (Real Madrid vs Barcelona).
- Allows potential users to experience the "Premium" data without registering first, driving interest.

## Verification
- **Demo Mode**: Verified that the "Ver Análisis Demo" button works on the landing page without login.
- **Admin Access**: Verified that `/admin` is protected and "God Mode" successfully upgrades the current user.
- **Data Quality**: Confirmed that the "Deep Analysis" shows rich, narrative-driven data (e.g., "Maldición histórica").

## Next Steps
- Implement real payment processing.
- Connect the "Deep Analysis" to live API data for all matches (currently hybrid real/mock).
