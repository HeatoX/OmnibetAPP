# Omnibet AI: Project Status Report

## Project Overview
**Omnibet AI** is a professional-grade sports analysis and prediction platform. It leverages live data from the ESPN API to provide real-time scores, detailed match analytics, and AI-driven insights to help users make informed betting decisions (for educational purposes).

## Architecture & Technology Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Global and Component-level) for a premium, custom look.
- **Data Source**: [ESPN API](https://site.api.espn.com/) (REST endpoints)
- **AI Integration**: Custom reasoning logic for match predictions (intended for integration with LLMs).
- **Backend / DB**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Ready for auth, logs, and user data).

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Live Scoreboard
- Real-time updates for multiple sports (Soccer, NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, ATP).
- Dynamic league slug mapping for accurate API calls.

### 2. Detailed Match Analysis
- **Head-to-Head (H2H)**: Visual history of past encounters.
- **Recent Form**: Last 5 matches performance guide.
- **Universal Roster**: Multi-strategy player listing that works even for cup matches and different league tiers.
- **Injuries & Officials**: Real-time reporting of lineup availability and match officials.

### 3. AI Predictions
- Rule-based "Reasoning" engine for analyzing team trends and providing bet suggestions.
- Professional match stories and "vantage points" generated for each game.

### 4. Specialized Dashboards
- **Performance Dashboard**: Tracks the success rate of AI predictions over time.
- **Admin Panel**: Control center for app settings and debugging.
- **History**: Archives of past predictions and outcomes.

## Current State & Recent Improvements

### Recently Completed
- **Smart Roster Fetching**: Implemented [fetchRosterUniversal](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/src/lib/real-data-service.js#502-561) which uses three strategies (Match League, Home League, and Smart Guess) to ensure rosters are never empty.
- **Form Fallback**: Fixed issues where Cup matches (like Coupe de France) lacked recent form by automatically fetching team schedules as a fallback.
- **Sport Universalization**: Enhanced mapping for Baseball (MLB), Football (NFL), and Hockey (NHL) endpoints.

### Work in Progress
- **Player Statistics Integration**: I am currently researching and mapping endpoints for "Points Per Game" (PPG) and other key metrics to display within the roster view.
- **NBA Stats Mapping**: Found `byathlete` statistics endpoint and verified data structure for NBA.
- **Soccer Stats Mapping**: Testing similar athlete statistics for soccer leagues.

## Next Steps
1.  **Complete Player Stats Mapping**: Finalize [formatRoster](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/src/lib/real-data-service.js#582-609) updates to include PPG and other metrics.
2.  **UI Stats Display**: Update [DetailedMatchAnalysis.jsx](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/src/components/DetailedMatchAnalysis.jsx) to show stats in the roster table.
3.  **Comprehensive Validation**: Perform a suite of tests across all sports to ensure data consistency.
4.  **UI Polishing**: Final aesthetic refinements to the "Analysis" view.
