# Dashboard Layout Refinement Walkthrough

We have finalized the OmniBet AI dashboard with a centered, organized, and professional layout.

## 🏁 Final Refinement Checklist

### 1. Centered Sport Categories
The **Categorías** (Sport Filter) are now perfectly centered on a single line. 
- On desktop, they spread out for quick selection.
- On mobile, they stay on one line with a smooth horizontal scroll to avoid clutter.

### 2. Live Summary "Button"
Located directly below the categories, the **Live Match Summary** has been redesigned as a sleek **centered pill-button**. 
- It displays "EN VIVO", "Próximos Partidos", and "Última Actualización" in a compact, readable format.
- It features a subtle pulse animation on the live indicator to draw attention.

### 3. Full-Width Premium Zone
The **Parlay Builder** and **Stats Analysis** now utilize the full horizontal space of the dashboard.
- This prevents text overlap or clipping.
- Team names like "San Francisco 49ers" and "Kansas City Chiefs" now fit perfectly even on smaller screens.

### 4. Direct Prediction Text
We replaced the "Probable:" prefix with a decisive **"GANA"** (e.g., "GANA Real Madrid").
- This makes the predictions feel more confident and professional.

## 🚀 Visual Flow
1. **Performance Banner:** Quick check of yesterday's results.
2. **Banker of the Day:** The single best bet of the day.
3. **Premium Center:** Full-width Parlay Builder.
4. **Análisis & Categorías:** Centered stats followed bycentered sport filters and the live status pill.
5. **Match Grid:** All matches filtered by the selected sport.
