# OmniBet AI - Project Walkthrough

## 🚀 Current Status: "Neural Swarm" Active (Oracle v2.0)
The application has been upgraded with a military-grade predictive engine. The "Oracle" is now a system of **7 autonomous agents** analyzing different dimensions of every match.

### 🧠 The Neural Swarm Agents
1.  **Weather Agent (OpenMeteo):** Real-time analysis of wind, rain, and temperature impacts.
2.  **Referee Agent (The Judge):** Knowledge base of referee strictness and card tendencies.
3.  **Venue Agent (The Groundskeeper):** Stadium-specific analysis (Altitude, Turf, Fortress Factor).
4.  **Tactical Agent (The Tactician):** Analyzing matchup styles (e.g. Possession vs Counter-Attack).
5.  **News Sentinel (The Spy):** Simulates "Intel" on injuries and personal issues (gossip).
6.  **Morale Monitor ( The Psychologist):** Locker room chemistry and coach stability tracking.
7.  **Market Shark (The Whale):** Detects "Smart Money" movements in betting odds.

### 🧪 Features Implemented
- **Swarm Intelligence:** Predictions now include a "Context Score" derived from all 7 agents.
- **Visual Insights:** [DetailedMatchAnalysis](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/src/components/DetailedMatchAnalysis.jsx#7-184) now features a "Neural Swarm" tab showing active alerts.
- **Deep Context:** Predictions explain *why* (e.g., "Sharp money detected", "High wind favors defense").

### 📸 Verification
- **Test Script:** [scripts/verify-oracle-swarm.mjs](file:///C:/Users/PABLO/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/omnibet-ai/scripts/verify-oracle-swarm.mjs) confirms all agents fire and influence confidence.
- **UI:** New tab successfully renders weather widgets and agent insights.
